Lockdown Experience Survey Form

Live on: https://ramchandragiri.github.io/survey_form/

This is freecodecamp.org Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a survey form project.

Issues that I will fixed later:

1. Adding more media queries to fix responsiveness in different situation. -Randomly selected 1000px to stack column
2. Finding better solution to centralized form container. - I made 3 unequal column grid with middle column occupying 40% area and set visibility of other 2 to hidden.

Need to learn more CSS. 

Thank you.
